# AnimeTwist Cogs
#### General and utility modules for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot/) v3.

This repo contains cogs (Plugins) I've written, as well as those I've modified and republished for a specific discord server use case.

## Cog Summaries

* **animerequests**: Automatic anime request system for [twist.moe](http://twist.moe) that compares twist's database and uses [Kitsu](https://kitsu.io)'s API for all the details.
* **anisearch**: Slightly modified version of [Jintaku's Anisearch Cog](https://github.com/Jintaku/Jintaku-Cogs-V3/tree/master/anisearch) that adds Anime Twist and Kitsu Integration.
* **confessions**: Lets you Send a anonymous message to a specific discord channel for people that want to vent and confess anonymously.
* **suggestions**: Lets you have a suggestion box (channel), that is organized in small embedded boxs with down and up vote reactions.
